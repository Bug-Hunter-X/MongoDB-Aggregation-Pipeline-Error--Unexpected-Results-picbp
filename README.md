# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using MongoDB's aggregation framework. The bug involves an incorrectly constructed pipeline that leads to unexpected results.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code snippet shows an aggregation pipeline designed to group documents by a specific field and count the occurrences. However, due to an error in either the `$match`, `$group`, or `$sort` stage, the pipeline is not producing the correct output.

## Solution
The solution involves reviewing and correcting the aggregation pipeline to ensure it accurately reflects the intended logic. The `bugSolution.js` file contains the corrected code.  The issue might be due to incorrect field names, missing stages, or incorrect operator usage.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install MongoDB and run a local instance.
3. Load sample data into a collection.
4. Execute the `bug.js` script to observe the incorrect output.
5. Execute the `bugSolution.js` script to see the correct output.

## Lessons Learned
- Carefully review each stage of the aggregation pipeline.
- Ensure that field names are correct.
- Verify the logic of each aggregation operator.
- Test the pipeline with various data sets to identify edge cases.
